The evil ZetaCorp has kidnapped your girlfriend! Are you a bad enough
dude to hack into ZetaCorp and rescue her?

The setting is Altea, a planet much like our own -- specifically, the
mean streets of Onyxopolis. Before you stands the towering spire of
ZetaCorp, a massive conglomerate with its nose in many areas
(including the seedy and licentious Onyxopolis underground). You play
the role of Lorn Zender, a.k.a. NullAwesome, former punk rocker and
Altea's coolest hacker vigilante! With your trusty Portable Access
Console (P.A.C.) at your side, you can hack ZetaCorp's systems,
infiltrate their facilities, and gather intel that will lead you to
your lady love, as well as expose their shady dealings to the
world. But don't get caught -- you won't last a second against the
security guards or patrol drones!

Hurry! She is waiting!

This is basically a sidescrolling platformer similar to games from the
late 1980s or early 1990s, such as _Duke Nukem_ or _Dangerous
Dave_. It has a hacking mechanic borrowed from the likes of
_Watch\_Dogs_; tapping the PAC button will freeze your character in
place and present targets over "hackable" items in the
environment. Tapping a hacking target will have various effects: you
can access information, control elevators and robots, etc.

Aside from your PAC, you are basically unarmed. You will have to use
your wits, your hacking skills, and the environment to overcome
enemies and reach the goal.

Still VERY much a work in progress.
